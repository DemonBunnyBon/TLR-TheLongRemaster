TLR is a visual overhaul mod for The Long Dark.

The Long Dark has been around for a while, and has been updated countless times in the past years. Understandably, newer assets tend to be of higher quality, but a lot of the older graphical elements went neglected, never to be updated.


This mod aims to revitalize many visual assets throughout the game, including: geometry, textures, and many other miscellaneous graphics, while staying true to the style of TLD.
Everything in the mod is hand-crafted from scratch, trying to stay as true as possible to the source material while also giving all the assets more detail and making them superior quality.


Currently, the mod is in very early stages of development, as I'm working on it alone it will take a long time to finish, if it ever even gets to that point.
The alpha version features a handful of remastered models and textures for props, including:

- The iconic blue armchair,
- Certain types of beds and pillows,
- Dishware (including transparent cups!),
- Containers such as lockers, cabinets and the metal desk,
- and more.

There is many more to come, but the proccess is slow and tedious, so please be patient.

# Installation
